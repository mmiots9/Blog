<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>Ggplot 2 is a very useful graphic package that allows us to recreate almost every type of graph in the exact way we imagine it, thanks to a huge number of functions and related packages.
In this post, we will analyze the basis of this package, starting from how to create simple graphs analyzing the 3 indispensable components of the code.
When I talk about ‚Äúcomponents‚Äù, I mean the different types of commands that are needed to create a graph with ggplot2.
There are 8 components:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Data</p></li>
<li><p>Mapping</p></li>
<li><p>Geometries</p></li>
<li><p>Statistics</p></li>
<li><p>Scales</p></li>
<li><p>Facets</p></li>
<li><p>Coordinates</p></li>
<li><p>Theme</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Today, we will focus on the first 3 because those are the ones that requires informations by us; in fact, the others can be omitted since that already have default values.
Here is representet the minimal version of the ggplo2 command:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = &lt;data&gt;) +
  &lt;geom_function&gt;(mapping = aes(&lt;mapping&gt;))</code></pre>
<p>Often, <code>data =</code> and <code>mapping =</code> are implied.</p>
<div id="data" class="section level1">
<h1>Data</h1>
<p>Let‚Äôs start with the easyest part, <em>data</em>.
In the function above, &lt;data&gt; should be replaced with the dataframe/tibble from which data must be taken.
In this post, we will use the standard dataframe <em>mtcars</em>.</p>
<div id="geometries" class="section level2">
<h2>Geometries</h2>
<p>The second part of the code starts with the geom_function, that is the ‚Äúgeometry‚Äù that our graph must assume.
The most used geometries are <code>geom_point()</code> for scatter plot, <code>geom_bar()</code> and <code>geom_col()</code> for barplots, <code>geom_boxplot()</code> for boxplot and so on so forth.
There are lots of geometric functions, and they are strictly related to an other component, <em>statistics</em>. For these reasons, relationships between these two components will be analyzed in a future post.
Below, two examples of different <code>geom_</code>.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:geom1"></span>
<img src="/en/R/teoria/Intro ggplot2/Indroduzone%20a%20ggplot2.en_files/figure-html/geom1-1.png" alt="Same data but with different geom_. Above, geom_pont(); below, geom_smooth()" width="672" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 1: Same data but with different geom_. Above, geom_pont(); below, geom_smooth()
</p>
</div>
<p>An interesting feature of ggplo2 is the ease with which it is possible to use different geometric functions on the same (or different) data onto the same plot.
All common characteristics must be put inside <code>ggplot()</code>, while geom-specific inputs must be explicated into the corresponding geometric function.
For example, combining the two plots above:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = hp)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = F)</code></pre>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:geom2"></span>
<img src="/en/R/teoria/Intro ggplot2/Indroduzone%20a%20ggplot2.en_files/figure-html/geom2-1.png" alt="Union of two different geometries in the same plot" width="672" />
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="mapping" class="section level2">
<h2>Mapping</h2>
<p>Thorugh mapping inputs, we tell ggplot2 which variables to plot and other aesthetic parameters, such as color, fill, shape, and others.
Let‚Äôs see how it works.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = mtcars) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = mpg, y = hp))</code></pre>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:scatter"></span>
<img src="/en/R/teoria/Intro ggplot2/Indroduzone%20a%20ggplot2.en_files/figure-html/scatter-1.png" alt="Basic scatter plot" width="672" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 3: Basic scatter plot
</p>
</div>
<p>In this example, we told ggplot 2 which variables to plot in x an y axis in the <code>aes()</code> parameter.</p>
<div id="change-aestheticsmapping-of-all-the-graph" class="section level3">
<h3>Change aesthetics/mapping of all the graph</h3>
<p>If we want to change some aesthetics (color, shape, ‚Ä¶) to all the data in the graph, we have to specify them outside <code>aes()</code>.
For example, here we changed both color and shape of all the points.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = mtcars) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = mpg, y = hp), color = &quot;blue&quot;, shape = 3)</code></pre>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:scatter2"></span>
<img src="/en/R/teoria/Intro ggplot2/Indroduzone%20a%20ggplot2.en_files/figure-html/scatter2-1.png" alt="Points color and shape changed in a scatter plot" width="672" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 4: Points color and shape changed in a scatter plot
</p>
</div>
<p>There a lots of aesthetics and mapping characteristics for each &lt;geom&gt;; for this reason, I will not discuss in details in this post. I suggest to look to the help file of each geometry.</p>
</div>
<div id="change-aestheticsmapping-based-on-a-third-variable." class="section level3">
<h3>Change aesthetics/mapping based on a third variable.</h3>
<p>The same aesthetics/mapping characteristics can be changed based on a third variable or condition.
In this case, they sould be put inside <code>aes()</code>, since not all observation will have the same characteristics in the plot.
<em>Example</em>
We want to discriminate cars that weight less than 3.250 in a scatter plot of mpg and hp.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = mtcars) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = mpg, y = hp, color = wt &lt; 3.25))</code></pre>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:scatter3"></span>
<img src="/en/R/teoria/Intro ggplot2/Indroduzone%20a%20ggplot2.en_files/figure-html/scatter3-1.png" alt="Scatter plot with different colors based upon a condition" width="672" />
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>As we can see, a legend that helps us understanding color mapping has appeared.</p>
<p>This, and other mappings, can be done using also a categorical (or a continue) variable:</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:scatter4"></span>
