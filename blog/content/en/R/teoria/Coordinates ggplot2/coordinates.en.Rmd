Let's continue the series on GGPLOT2 analyzing the penultimate component, the **coordinates**.
The functions of this component will allow us to modify some characteristics of the axes, fundamental to finally create a *pieplot* with GGPLOT2.

# Ratio and axes flip
Let's start by looking at a function that allows us to decide in what ratio the axes must be; in other words, how many units on the y axis does one unit of the x axis correspond to?
Let's see an example right away.

```{r fixed1, fig.cap = "Default graph", echo=FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_point(aes(x = mpg, y = drat, color = factor(carb))) +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Carb")
```
By default, ggplot2 tries to make the graph as "beautiful" as possible in terms of axis dimensions, even using different scales for the two axes (as in the figure \@ref(fig:fixed1)).  

Instead, if we want to have the two axes having the same scale, we have to add the command `coord_fixed()`. The result would be this:

```{r fixed2, fig.cap = "coord_fixed command added to the previous graph", echo=FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_point(aes(x = mpg, y = drat, color = factor(carb))) +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Carb") +
  coord_fixed()
```
Now the two axes have the same scale, and in fact the y axis is very flattened with respect to the x axis. To change the ratio between the y axis and the x axis, and thus fix the graph, you need to set the `ratio` input.
Testing with `ratio = 10`, we get this graph:

```{r fixed3, fig.cap = "Graph with ratio setted", echo=FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_point(aes(x = mpg, y = drat, color = factor(carb))) +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Carb") +
  coord_fixed(ratio = 10)
```
The graph is clear again.
This function may not seem very useful now, but it may turn out as we need to create a graph that is a bit squashed towards the x-axis or the y-axis.

To conclude this mini chapter, I'm going to talk briefly about the `coord_flip` function which, as you can guess from the name, inverts x-axis and y-axis. This can be useful when you are forced to use geometry or statistics on the x (or y) axis but you would like to have a graph in which the modified values are on the y axis (or viceversa). Just add this little function at the end of the graph command and that's it.

# Zoom and transformations 
One thing that the *coord_* component allows us to do is to zoom the chart without losing any data (which would happen if we set the axis limits using scales_ in order to zoom in on the chart).
The way to zoom is given by the `xlim` and` ylim` inputs of each `coord_` command; if in the graph you have not chosen to use any *coord* modifications, remember that the default value is `coord_cartesian` and that you just need to add that command with the right inputs.

In our case, if we want to zoom the graph in figure \@ref(fig:fixed1) to highlight the low values, we should add `coord_cartesian(xlim = c(10, 17), ylim = c(2.5, 4))`. Here is the result:

```{r zoom, fig.cap = "Zoom on the lower part of the graph in figure \\@ref(fig:fixed1)", echo=FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_point(aes(x = mpg, y = drat, color = factor(carb))) +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Carb") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(10, 17), ylim = c(2.5, 4))
```

A very similar argument applies to transformations related to axes, such as the application of a logarithmic scale on them.
The command is `coord_trans`, and the input in this case is `y (or x) = "log"`.

But *why* these differences?
Scale applies the changes at the beginning, while coord does it later, once the data are already plotted. In fact, by setting restrictive limits with scales, R will say that it has <u>eliminated</u> some data, because that data do not fall within the imposed limits; on the other hand, with coord the data are first plotted, then a zoom is made in the section delimited by the limits set.
A similar thing happens for transformations: using coord for it, breaks will have clearer values than those created by scale.

# Polar coordinates
Here we are at a very important command for the construction of a pieplot (but not only!): `coord_polar`.
This command allows us to transform the axes from cartesian to polar. There are various inputs:
<li>theta: the variable mapped as an angle ("x" or "y") </li>
<li>start: the offset in radiant from which to start the graph with respect to 12:00 </li>
<li>direction: clockwise (1, default), counterclockwise (-1) </li>

Let's immediately see an example in which the data in y are used as angle values:

```{r polary, fig.cap = "Polar coordinates on a barplot"}
ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = factor(cyl)), fill = c("red3", "blue3", "green4")) +
  coord_polar(theta = "y", start = - 1.57) +
  expand_limits(y = 15) +
  xlab("Cyl") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 15, 3))
```
I added `expand_limit` because, by default, the limit of the theta angle is equal to the maximum value of the corresponding y axis of the cartesian coordinates, making the one relative to the 8 cylinders become a single circle.

# Pieplot
Let's see now how to create a pieplot on ggplot2.
Let's start from the example in figure \@ref(fig:polary), this time putting the x axis as the theta angle variable:

```{r polarx, fig.cap = "Coord_polar with theta = x-axis", echo=FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = factor(cyl)), fill = c("red3", "blue3", "green4")) +
  coord_polar(theta = "x", start = - 1.57) +
  xlab("Cyl")
```

It looks like we're almost there, which is the right direction for a pieplot. Unfortunately, we're wrong.
To create a pieplot on ggplot2 it is necessary to create a single-column barplot whose values on the y axis represent the various reference values.

```{r pie1, fig.cap = "Piplot: first step"}

# create a df in which are stored the number of cylinder and the corresponding counts

df <- mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl = factor(cyl)) %>%
  summarise(n = n())


ggplot(df) +
  geom_col(aes(x = 0, y = n, fill = cyl))
```

Once you get to this point, it might be intuitive to use values in y as values for the theta angle.

```{r pie2, fig.cap = "Complete pieplot"}
ggplot(df) +
  geom_col(aes(x = 0, y = n, fill = cyl)) +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  theme_void()
```

Here is our pieplot.

Through `geom_text` we could add the percentages and have a graph like this:

```{r piecom, fig.cap= "Pieplot with percentages", echo = FALSE}

df <- df %>%
  mutate(cyl = factor(cyl, levels = c(8, 6, 4)),
         cumulative = cumsum(n),
         midpoint = cumulative - n / 2,
         my_label = paste0(cyl, " cylinders - ", round(n / sum(n) * 100, 2), "%"))

ggplot(df) +
  geom_col(aes(x = 0, y = n, fill = cyl)) +
  geom_text(aes(x = c(0, 0.15, 0), y = midpoint, label = my_label)) +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  theme_nothing()

```

But, we will see later how to use `geom_text` well to jot down important information on our charts.
