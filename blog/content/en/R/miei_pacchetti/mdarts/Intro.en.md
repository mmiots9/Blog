<div style="text-align: justify;">
Hi everyone! <br> 
In this post I will briefly talk about this new project: how it was born, how it will develop and future expectations.<br>
I start by explaining the birth of it. This project was born from the combination of three of my passions: programming, data analysis and, of course, the game for darts.
There are many apps that allow you to play darts, and there is already a package of R for this; but I wanted something different! <br> <br>
In addition to being an excellent training for programming, I wanted a package that, of course, takes into account the scores etc, but also makes an analysis of the data that come out of it.  
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">And here comes the structure that I would like to give to this project:</p>
<li>Functions for playing classic darts games: 501, round the clock, and others</li>
<li>Functions for training with different games: power scoring, closing and accuracy</li>
<li>Functions for data analysis, with dashboards and reports that can also be used outside R (ideally in html)</li>
<br>
So many ideas in mind, and lots of things to develop. It will be one of my longest, most complex and, at the same time, intriguing projects I have ever done.
It will be my first complete package, with functions that call other package functions, where the edge between being all right (and "cool") and all being a bug is very thin.
I still don't know when I will be able to achieve the goals I have in mind, but I can't wait to get started and fine-tune it all.
On the blog I will gradually publish posts related to the functions, with explanations and examples, as usual.
<br>
<br>
But, obviously, I couldn't make a post in which I didn't say anything really concrete: that's why I tell you that on <a href="https://github.com/mmiots9/mdarts" target="_blank">github</a> version 1.0 is out, with the first functions, all to be discovered.
In the next few days the first post will be released, which concerns the function for the 501 game. 
<br>Stay tuned!
