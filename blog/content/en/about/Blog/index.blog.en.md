The idea of the blog was born from the desire to test myeself, learning unknown languages (HTML and CSS).
I immediately wanted to divide the blog into different sections, having many ideas in mind: first of all, the idea of helping those who were approaching the R language attracted me. This is why I created the [R theory](https://miotsdata.netlify.app/en/r/teoria/) section, in which I try to make it as easy as possible to understand the commands through practical and immediate examples.
Furthermore, I also wanted to use this space as a portfolio to present my works and my codes, created during this journey to help me in the analysis of data and in their manipulation. To see them, you can go to the [R my packages](https://miotsdata.netlify.app/en/r/miei_pacchetti/) section, where you will find the R packages I have developed, and in the [Bash my functions](https://miotsdata.netlify.app/en/bash/mie_funzioni/), where I talk about functions for Bash/Terminal.

Finally, I felt the strong need to counteract the huge amount of fake news that was circulating and that undermined the credibility of the whole scientific community. After using the classic social platforms to try to fight this phenomenon (which led me to some collaborations that you can find in the [Publications](https://miotsdata.netlify.app/it/publications/) section), I decided to take the discussion more seriously. In the [Pills](https://miotsdata.netlify.app/it/pillole/) section you will find short writings through which I try to convey in an understandable way, especially to the insiders, some notions of science (biology in particular) and the importance of a correct data analysis.

<u>Technical info</u>:
The blog is a static site created thanks to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), using the [Zzo](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-zzo/) ( with some minor cosmetic changes) theme.
I write the posts as .md or .Rmd files (if there are graphics or functions to be evaluated) on RStudio.
