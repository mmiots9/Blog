Hi everyone,
Here I introduce myself and quickly present this project entitled "Miots data".

I am Matteo Miotto, a student of the master in "Genomic Data Science" at the University of Pavia.
My studies have always been geared towards biotechnology, with a bachelor degree in "medical and pharmaceutical biotechnology" and a master's degree in "Biotechnology and Medical Biology", both at the Vita-Salute San Raffaele University (MI).
I've always focused on the study of viruses, with a bachelor thesis on the biotechnological applications of bacteriophages and a master's thesis 12-month internship in the Viral Pathogens and Biosecurity Unit (HSR), in which I focused on the study of the Zika virus.

So, how did I end up embarking on this new path?
During the first lockdown (March 2020), I started following the daily update of the data concerning infected/dead patients. Tired of doing the calculations with excel every time and aiming to have something more automated and fast, I picked up the dear and old Matlab (companion of adventures during the bachelor bioinformatics course, and prematurely abandoned after the exam) and wrote a code that allowed me to have all the calculations quickly and that made me come out with clear graphs.
From there a world opened up to me. I started with in-depth courses on Matlab, understanding its potential to automate all that part of laboratory data analysis (copy and paste of excel files) that was time-consuming and error prone.
Then, I took online courses on Python and R, and on their application in statistics.
Having found my way, I decided to enroll in the Master in order to specialize myself.

Here we come to this project.
I decided to bring together everything I learn during the course and external insights in one place, in such a way as to have it indexed and ready for every occasion. I was also attracted to the idea of helping those who approached R, and it is for these reasons that the [R theory](https://miotsdata.netlify.app/en/r/teoria/) section  was born.
I also wanted to use this space as a showcase to present my works and my codes, created during this journey to help me in the analysis of data and in their manipulation. You can find them in the [My codes](https://miotsdata.netlify.app/en/r/miei_codici/) section.
Finally, always during the bad period of the pandemic, I felt the need to fight the huge amount of fake news that was circulating and that undermined the credibility of the whole scientific community. After having used the classic social platforms to try to counter this phenomenon, which led me to some collaborations (which you can find in the [Publications](https://miotsdata.netlify.app/en/publications/) section), I decided to take it more seriously. In the [pills](https://miotsdata.netlify.app/en/pillole/) section you will find short writings in which I try to convey in an understandable way the importance of a correct data analysis and notions of science (biology in particular), especially for those who last saw science at school.

I've already written too much,
I hope you will find this project useful and interesting, and that you want to support it by sharing with your friends/relatives.
