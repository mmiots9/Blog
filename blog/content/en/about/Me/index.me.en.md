Hello everybody,
I use this page to quickly introduce myself.

**<u>Background</u>**
My name is Matteo Miotto, and I'm a "Genomic Data Science" master's student at the University of Pavia.
My studies have always been oriented towards biotechnology, so that I have got a bachelor degree in "Medical and Pharmaceutical Biotechnologies" and a master's degree in "Biotechnology and Medical Biology", both at the Vita-Salute San Raffaele University (MI).
I focused on the study of virology, with a bachelor thesis on the biotechnological applications of bacteriophages and a 12-months master thesis internship in the Viral Pathogens and Biosafety unit (HSR-MI), focusing on the study of the Zika virus.

So, how did I end up embarking on this new path?
During the first lockdown (March 2020), like many, I began to follow and analyze the daily updates of the infected/dead people from SARS-CoV-2. Tired of using Excel and wanting something more automated and faster, I "exhumed" the dear and old Matlab (companion in adventures during the bachelor bioinformatics course, and prematurely abandoned after the exam) and I worked out a code that would allow me to carry out all the calculations quickly,  and that gave me a clear graph.
From there a world opened up to me. I started with in-depth courses on Matlab, seeing its potential to automate all that part of laboratory data analysis (copy and paste of excel files, data analysis) that was long to run and error-prone.
Subsequently, I took online courses of Python and R, and their application in statistics.
Having found my way, I decided to enroll in the Master to specialize.

**<u>Hobbies</u>**
I played basketball, tennis and other sports during high school. Currently I enjoy tennis and padel, but offer me any ball sport and I'll be there (except rugby, for obvious reasons).
I love to play the electric guitar and music has an important role in my life.
I would like to learn how to cook better, learning new recipes and letting my parents and friends taste them.
